# CFPsDatabase
The SQL script creates a database with the required tables to store information about Call For Paper events. There are three types of CFP events which can be inserted into the database: conference, journal or book. Additional information such as activities, topics covered, and organizers of events can also be stored in this database. The database also contains a summary table to store the number of events for each type and updates it using triggers. The SQL script creates the necessary tables and triggers to store this information.
The Java program is a GUI which allows users to insert a new CFP event into the database without using any SQL.
